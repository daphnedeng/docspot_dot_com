### 24th September 2018

**What is good about the existing page or working well?**

1. The footer is the best part on the page.
2. Content stays in the center of the page which is easy to follow

**What areas need improvement or not working well (feel free to include screenshot)? Why they don’t work well?**
1. ![](old_homepage_screenshot/3steps.jpg)
Very busy, too much text, not sure how helpful it is for user (expecial first time user). The gradient background is not modern, seems old.
2. ![](old_homepage_screenshot/somedropdown.jpg)Doesn’t work well with the header, looks like a white bar that randomly “pasted” there.
3.	 ![](old_homepage_screenshot/somedropdown.jpg)Too much text, not 100% responsive 
4.	 ![](old_homepage_screenshot/lineoftext.jpg)This line of text doesn’t feel part of the page
5.	 ![](old_homepage_screenshot/docreviews.jpg)The reviews for doctors section is too busy, too much text. Not 100% responsive. The arrow pointing the date which doesn’t make sense. The doctor’s title seems too long. Feel like the person with avatar left the review.
6.	 ![](old_homepage_screenshot/somelinks.jpg)The layout doesn’t seem right.
7.	 ![](old_homepage_screenshot/slogan.jpg)The tagline is small. Not sure how helpful is it for users.
